# Professional Learning Design: Quick Reference Guide

## The 6 Principles of Adult Learning (Andragogy)

1. **Need to Know** - Explain WHY before HOW
2. **Self-Concept** - Give learners control and choice
3. **Prior Experience** - Build on what they know
4. **Readiness** - Make it timely and relevant
5. **Problem-Centered** - Focus on real challenges, not abstract theory
6. **Intrinsic Motivation** - Connect to personal/professional goals

## SMART Learning Objectives Formula

**[Action Verb] + [Specific Content] + [Context/Condition] + [Criteria for Success]**

Example: "By the end of this session, participants will be able to apply three questioning techniques from cognitive coaching during a role-play conversation."

## Bloom's Taxonomy Action Verbs by Level

| Level | Verbs |
|-------|-------|
| Remember | Define, list, identify, label, state |
| Understand | Explain, describe, summarize, interpret, classify |
| Apply | Demonstrate, solve, implement, execute, use |
| Analyze | Compare, contrast, examine, differentiate, categorize |
| Evaluate | Justify, critique, defend, assess, judge |
| Create | Design, develop, construct, formulate, produce |

## Backward Design in 3 Steps

1. **Identify Desired Results** - What should learners understand and be able to do?
2. **Determine Evidence** - How will we know they learned it?
3. **Plan Experiences** - What activities will prepare them for the assessment?

## Optimal Session Lengths

- **Microlearning:** 6-10 minutes maximum
- **Focused Session:** 15-30 minutes
- **Standard Workshop:** 60-90 minutes with breaks every 20-30 minutes

## Cognitive Load: The 3-7 Rule

Working memory can handle **3-7 pieces of information** at once.

**Design Implications:**
- Chunk content into small segments
- Use spacing between topics
- Minimize extraneous information
- Provide clear visuals and structure

## 15-Minute Session Template

| Time | Activity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 0-2 min | Hook & Frame | WHY this matters |
| 3-8 min | Teach & Model | New concepts + example |
| 9-13 min | Practice & Apply | Active learning activity |
| 14-15 min | Synthesize | Key takeaway + next action |

## Remote/Hybrid Best Practices

**Technology Essentials:**
- Video platform with breakout rooms
- Chat and polling for engagement
- Collaborative documents/whiteboards
- Recording for accessibility

**Engagement Strategies:**
- Call on remote learners by name
- Use chat continuously
- Create mixed breakout groups
- Provide multiple ways to participate
- Monitor engagement metrics

**Blended Learning:**
- **Async:** Pre-work, reflection, practice
- **Sync:** Discussion, collaboration, Q&A, coaching

## Activity Design Checklist

- [ ] Mirrors real-world scenarios (authentic)
- [ ] Requires active participation (experiential)
- [ ] Creates a usable work product (immediate utility)
- [ ] Includes reflection time (metacognition)
- [ ] Allows for collaboration (peer learning)

## Learner Persona Template

**Name:** [Give them a name and photo]

**Role:** [Job title, years of experience]

**Context:** [Where they work, daily responsibilities]

**Prior Knowledge:** [What they already know about topic]

**Motivations:** [What drives them to learn this]

**Barriers:** [Time, confidence, resources, support]

**Preferences:** [How they like to learn]

**Pain Points:** [What problems does this solve for them]

## Coaching Conversation Structure

**The Impact Cycle:**
1. **Identify** - What specific goal do you want to work on?
2. **Learn** - What strategy or practice could help?
3. **Improve** - Try it and collect data
4. **Refine** - Analyze results and adjust

**Effective Coaching Questions:**
- What did you notice about [specific aspect]?
- What do you think contributed to that outcome?
- If you could re-teach that, what might you try?
- What support would help you improve [specific skill]?

## Cognitive Coaching: The 4 P's

1. **Pause** - Give thinking time (3-5 seconds)
2. **Paraphrase** - Reflect back what you heard
3. **Probe** - Ask deeper questions
4. **Prime** - Prepare facilitator for upcoming sessions

## 2x10 Feedback Model

**2 Positives:**
- Specific observation of what went well
- Impact on learners

**1 Growth Area:**
- Objective, non-judgmental observation
- Framed as question or exploration

**0 Evaluative Language:**
- No "good/bad," "right/wrong"
- Facilitator interprets the data

## Kolb's Learning Cycle Integration

Every session should include:

1. **Concrete Experience** - Do something (activity, scenario, case)
2. **Reflective Observation** - What happened? What did you notice?
3. **Abstract Conceptualization** - What theory or principle explains this?
4. **Active Experimentation** - How will you apply this in your context?

## Transfer of Learning

**Near Transfer:**
- Very similar context to training
- Almost identical tasks
- Design: Practice exact scenarios learners will face

**Far Transfer:**
- Different context from training
- Adapted principles and judgment
- Design: Varied examples, multiple contexts, teach adaptability

**Support Transfer:**
- Job aids and templates
- Follow-up coaching
- Accountability structures
- Practice in authentic settings

## Session Design Workflow

1. **Analyze Audience** - Who are they? What do they need?
2. **Define Transfer Goal** - What should they be able to do in the real world?
3. **Write SMART Objectives** - Observable, measurable outcomes
4. **Design Assessment** - How will we know they achieved it?
5. **Plan Activities** - What practice prepares them for assessment?
6. **Sequence Content** - Chunk, space, reduce cognitive load
7. **Prepare Materials** - Slides, handouts, job aids
8. **Test & Refine** - Pilot and iterate based on feedback

## Differentiation Strategies

**Leveling Content:**
- **Novice:** More background, step-by-step, scaffolding
- **Intermediate:** Balance theory and application
- **Expert:** Nuanced cases, edge cases, customization

**Provide Choice:**
- Multiple activities targeting same objective
- Various formats (video, reading, discussion)
- Different complexity levels

**Flexible Grouping:**
- Homogeneous groups for targeted support
- Heterogeneous groups for peer learning
- Self-selected based on interest or readiness

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Lecture for more than 10 minutes without interaction
- Activities without clear connection to objectives
- Content overload (trying to cover too much)
- No time for practice or application
- Ignoring learner context and prior experience
- One-size-fits-all approach
- No follow-up support for transfer

## Quality Indicators

**A Well-Designed Session:**
- Starts with WHY (relevance to learners)
- Has 1-3 clear, measurable objectives
- Includes multiple opportunities for active participation
- Connects new learning to prior experience
- Provides authentic practice in realistic scenarios
- Builds in reflection and metacognition
- Ends with concrete next actions
- Offers job aids or resources for ongoing use

**Effective Facilitation:**
- Uses open-ended questions
- Pauses for think time
- Listens actively and paraphrases
- Validates multiple perspectives
- Adjusts based on learner needs in the moment
- Creates psychologically safe environment

**Strong Coaching:**
- Builds trust through partnership
- Uses data, not judgment
- Asks more than tells
- Focuses on one discrete skill at a time
- Provides specific, actionable feedback
- Follows up consistently over time

## The Core Question

**Filter every design decision through this:**

"Will this help learners transfer skills to their real-world context and achieve meaningful outcomes?"

If the answer is no, revise or remove it.
